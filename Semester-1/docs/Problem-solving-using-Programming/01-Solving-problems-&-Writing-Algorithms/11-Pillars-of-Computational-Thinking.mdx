# Computational Thinking

## Lesson Objective
In this lesson you will learn about what computational thinking is, its key features and about the skills related to computational thinking.You will learn about everything in detail with the help of some real life examples. This is a **self-paced** class.

:thought_balloon: What is the first thing that comes to mind when we say the words *"computational thinking"*?

## Introduction
Computational thinking is the step that comes before programming. *It’s the process of breaking down a problem into simple enough steps that even a computer would understand.* We all know that computers take instructions very literally, sometimes to comic results. If we don’t provide computers with instructions that are precise and detailed, our algorithm might forget vital actions that our human brain takes for granted.

>For example, consider a simple activity like **brushing your teeth**. At first it sounds like a simple enough task, but in fact, brushing your teeth involves many simple steps. First, you’ll need a toothbrush and toothpaste. You’ll need a sink with cold water. You’ll need to put the toothpaste on the brush. Don’t forget to turn on the water and run your brush underneath. As you see, such a simple activity actually involves many steps, if you miss one step or put one out of order you might end up with a huge mess!


**The need to study Computational Thinking:**
:pushpin: Computational thinking helps students develop skills that are attractive for future employment opportunities. 

📌 :pushpin: Computer science is the fastest growing job market and students' skills in coding are highly sought after for job applications. While the hard tech skills are very important, it’s the softer skills of reasoning and problem solving that employers really find attractive. 

📌 :pushpin: These skills for success are the key to understanding why computational thinking is so valuable.

While there are obvious benefits for future employment, it’s the development of critical thinking and emotional competencies that set up students for long-term success. When children learn computational thinking skills, it helps them to develop skills important for not only STEM subjects, but also across the social sciences and language arts. In fact, a recent study demonstrated that computational thinking skills were highly correlated with a non-verbal measure of intelligence.


We would like to introduce an amazing course on Computational thinking through coursera.
