# Computational Thinking - Pattern Recognition

Pattern is everything around in this digital world. A pattern can either be seen physically or it can be observed mathematically by applying algorithms. 

>Example: The colours on the clothes, speech pattern, etc. In computer science, a pattern is represented using vector feature values. 

## What is Pattern Recognition? 

Pattern recognition is the process of recognizing patterns by using a machine learning algorithm. Pattern recognition can be defined as the *classification of data based on knowledge already gained or on statistical information extracted* from patterns and/or their representation. One of the important aspects of pattern recognition is its application potential.

**Examples of Pattern Recognition in Everyday Life**

Pattern recognition is the foundation of our knowledge. As infants, we used patterns to make sense of the world around us, to begin to respond verbally and grow our language skills, and to develop behavioural responses and cultivate connections in this world.

> Beyond this, pattern recognition also occurs when scientists are trying to identify the cause of a disease outbreak by looking for similarities in the different cases to determine the source of the outbreak.

> Additionally, when Netflix recommends shows based on your interests or a chatbot pesters you on a website, the technology (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) rely on pattern recognition.

Let’s dive into problems based on pattern recognition. 

**Sample problem 1**

Can you spot the sequence in these numbers ?  

{ 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25…..  }

*Answer:* This is an Arithmetic Progression whose common difference is 3 and first term is 1
With this information available we can calculate the nth term in this sequence easily

 Now, try to unfold patterns in the following questions

**Sample problem 2**

Identify the figure that completes the pattern.
